# Softis — SPA (GitHub Pages ready)

Upload this folder to a GitHub repository and enable **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Branch: `main` / root**.

Included:
- `index.html` — your app (unchanged).
- `404.html` — SPA redirect so deep links work.
- `.nojekyll` — disables Jekyll.
- `images/logo_32.png` — favicon referenced by the page.
